# Note that align and DEA will be created for you.

# original_datadir is the path to the original
# fastq input files
original_datadir: data/original_files
# working_datadir will be created for you
# and will contain working copies of the original
# input files.

seq_compressed: False
# working_alignment_dir will be created for you and
# will contain the results of alignging the input
# reads to the reference genome.
working_alignment_dir: align
# working_DEA_dir will be the directory
# containing the Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)

# Various settings needed to create the
# DESeq2 differential expression analysis Rscript file.
#
# org is the annotation database used to map GENE IDs to common gene names
# for this organism. The default database is for mouse: org.Mm.eg.db
# see https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Organism
# and search the table for "org." to see a list a list of compatible databases
org: org.At.tair.db

#
# dbkey is the data type, or column, in the organism annotation database that will
# be matched to the gene ID's in the expression data. This match will dictate what gene
# name will be returned. So, in the input data if your genes are identifyed by
# Entrez ID's, use the default dbkey, which is ENTREZID. The dbkey may be specific 
# to different databases. For example, TAIR is used for annotation derived from
# The Arabidopsis and Information Resource (TAIR).
dbkey: TAIR

#
# By default, a gProfiler pathway analysis is done on all the DE genes where p < 0.05.
# gProfilerkey is the organism database that the gProfiler software will use.
# See https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/organism-list for a list.
gProfilerkey: athaliana
