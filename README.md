# The RNA-Seq Toolkit #

These scripts were developed by Scott Givan and colleagues at the Informatics Research Core Facility at the University of Missouri in the USA.
These scripts are under constant development and improvement. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Scott at sgivan@yahoo.com.

Note that the most recent branch for the TopHat, Cufflinks, Cummerbund pipeline is "doku". The current branch that uses HISAT2, Stringtie and Ballgown is "HISAT2". The FirstSTAR branch is being adpated to use STAR and DESeq2.
