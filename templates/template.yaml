# Various settings needed for the DESeq2 differential expression analysis
#
# org is the annotation database used to map GENE IDs to common gene names
# for this organism. The default database is for mouse: org.Mm.eg.db
# see https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Organism
# and search the table for "org." to see a list a list of compatible databases
org: org.At.tair.db

#
# dbkey is the value in the organism database that will be matched to the
# gene ID's in the expression data. This match will dictate what gene
# name will be returned. The default dbkey is ENTREZID.
dbkey: TAIR

#
# gProfilerkey is the organism database that the gProfiler software will use.
# See https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/organism-list for a list.
