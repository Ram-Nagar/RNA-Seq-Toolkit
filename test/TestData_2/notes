125 thousand pairs of reads in fastq format with quality scores generated by the Illumina pipeline v 1.5.
One hundred thousand (80%) of the reads are from an Arabidopsis mRNA-Seq experiment, and 25,000 (20%) are
contaminants with the composition:
20000 Arabidopsis rRNA
 1250 Arabidopsis plastid genome
 1250 Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome
 2500 PhiX

The Arabidopsis reads were created from inserts of 268 bases and are of length 84.
The Arabidopsis reads were generously supplied by Dr. Chris Pires of the University of Missouri. 
The source of the contaminants is described below. The contaminant composition was constructed 
to be similar to some previously observed RNA-Seq results from other organisms. The program 
wgsim from Samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) was used to create the paired end 
sequences for the contaminants and their quality scores were copied from the supplied 
Arabidopsis data.
