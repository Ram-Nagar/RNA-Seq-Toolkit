#The RNA-Seq Toolkit#

These scripts were developed by Scott Givan and colleagues at the Informatics Research Core Facility at the University of Missouri in the USA. These tools are still under constant development and improvement. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Scott at sgivan@yahoo.com.

The "slurmy" branch is derived from the "HISAT2" branch. It is reconfigured to use the Slurm job scheduler instead of the LSF/openlava job
scheduler.
